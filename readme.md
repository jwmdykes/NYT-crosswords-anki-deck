## Sources

The dataset I used is from this medium article: https://medium.com/@maxdeutsch/how-i-mastered-the-saturday-nyt-crossword-puzzle-in-31-days-fe6a094edccd by Max Deutsch, which in turn was scraped from the website https://nyxcrossword.com/ (formerly NYTcrossword.com) created by Bill Ernest.
